# Library Management System

### KlaipÄ—da State College / Lithuania, 2024

This is a project work made to account for specific criteria whilst also bringing something usable and good.

This code reads authors and books from text files, allowing to sort them by genres and authors.

Compiled to be used with Java 17 in mind.

Feel free to peruse and read my dumb ass code.
